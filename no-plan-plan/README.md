# 🧠 NoPlanPlan

**NoPlanPlan** is a collaborative planning app for families who live in chaos but still get sh*t done.  
Originally built to plan a trip to Japan, now evolving into a full-blown tactical family command center.

## 🚀 Features (so far)
- 📝 Shared wishlist with links, images, and vote system
- 👥 User login via Firebase (each family member gets their own login)
- 🧠 Real-time updates across devices
- 📅 Logistics tracking (hotels, transport, checklists)
- 🛠️ Built with modern web tech for future expansion

Coming soon:
- 📷 Upload travel photos or location previews
- 🤖 AI-generated itineraries and "don’t miss this" suggestions
- 💬 Comments & tagging ("This one was YOUR idea, remember?")
- 🔔 Notifications so your family stops ignoring the plan
